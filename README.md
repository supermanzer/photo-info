# Photo Info
_A program for extracting information from image files (JPEG, NEF, etc)._

---

## Goal
The purpose of this application is to read the metadata from an image file and save that information as front-matter in a markdown file.  

This is intended to fasciliate using Markdown based web frameworks (e.g. [Nuxt Contet](https://content.nuxt.com/)) to share and display images.
